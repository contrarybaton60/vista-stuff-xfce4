# vista-stuff-xfce4
themes and other stuff made to resemble Windows Vista, specifically for the Xfce desktop environment.

You'll need the following packages for it to look good:
~~~
- compiz compizconfig-settings-manager emerald (window manager stuff)
- ayatana-indicator-display ayatana-indicator-sound cbatticon (system tray)
- obsidian-icon-theme (perferred icon theme I like to use)
- kvantum (to use the kvantum theme)
~~~
licenses are in the readme files in the folders
